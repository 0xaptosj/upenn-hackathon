# Aptos AI dev assistant

### Theme: dev tooling

### Prize: $1,000

## Objective

Train an AI model with Aptos specific data (e.g. docs, github, etc) to create a model that can answer all things related to building on Aptos. The end product should be a chat bot UI that can be integrated to aptos.dev or run as a standalone app.

## Resources

We have a request for proposal on Aptos grant registry, you can find the training data and more resources there.

Note: this hackathon objective is a simpler version of the RFP, you don't need to index the onchain data and the model doesn't need to have the knowledge of contracts deployed and the Aptos ecosystem. But if you do, that would be a huge plus!
