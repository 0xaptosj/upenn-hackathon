# Aptos DeFi aggregator

### Theme: DeFi, user facing products

### Prize: $1,000

## Objective

Next generational of DeFi aggregator or frontend should be powered by AI agents, users should be able to use all major Aptos DeFi within a single interface with LLM. For example, I asked agent to swap 1 APT to 5 USDC, the agent will find the best route and execute the transaction for me, and show me a preview of the transaction then ask me to sign it. In another way, agent should have knowledge of all major DeFi protocols and tokens on Aptos.

## Resources

[Metamove framework](https://metamove.build/) an all in one framework that already integrated a lot of Aptos DeFi protocols and some popular LLMs.
