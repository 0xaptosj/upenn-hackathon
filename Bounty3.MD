# AI framework for Aptos

### Theme: infra, dev toolings

### Prize: $1,000

## Objective

AI frameworks help developers build AI agents that interact with the Chain easier. They usually provide plugins for different models, DeFi protocols. [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) is the first framework supporting multiple chains. [Metamove](https://metamove.build/) is the first framework native to Aptos.

We want to see more frameworks dedicated to Aptos. So you can either build a new framework, fork Metamove or add interesting features to Metamove.

Whatever you decided to build, you are also highly encouraged to build a simple UI to demo the features of your framework.

## Resources

[Metamove framework](https://metamove.build/) an all in one framework that already integrated a lot of Aptos DeFi protocols and some popular LLMs.
